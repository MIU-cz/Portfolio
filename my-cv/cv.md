## **About Me**

I am a front-end developer and coder.  
In other words, I help company representatives find a human face on the Internet, make their business and the result of their business understandable to a wide range of people.

I can be useful for you in developing websites, landing pages for product promotion, creating product presentation and more.

And my experience will allow me to effectively apply new skills in practice when solving urgent problems in the business environment.
